# PydayNightFunkin
 This is a rewrite of Friday Night Funkin' in python. Why? Because, that's why! As with everything else I produce, nothing is done besides some really basic core functionality.

 Used libraries:  
  - Pyglet ([Github](https://www.github.com/pyglet/pyglet))
  - stb_vorbis ([Github](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c)|[Homepage](https://nothings.org/stb_vorbis))
