# PydayNightFunkin
 This is a rewrite of (accidentally half of HaxeFlixel) and Friday Night Funkin' in python and some Cython. Why? "Beep boop funny", camelCase looks ugly and as a proof to no-one that the `PlayState.hx` monolith is the worst, that would be why.  
 Not a lot is done, but you can at least click through some menus and partake in a few non-recorded, non-penalized vowel-screaming contests.
