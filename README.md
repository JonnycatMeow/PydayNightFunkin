# PydayNightFunkin
 This is a rewrite of Friday Night Funkin' in python (and some Cython). Why? Because, that's why!
 Not a lot is done, but you can at least click through some menus and partake in one out of three non-recorded, non-penalized vowel-screaming contests.

 Used libraries:  
  - pyglet *As the driver of the show* ([Github](https://www.github.com/pyglet/pyglet))
  - stb_vorbis *As the audio-wise driver of the show* ([Github](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c) | [Homepage](https://nothings.org/stb_vorbis))
  - loguru *As an easy and camelCase-free logging tool* ([Github](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru))
  - schema *As a data integrity checker* ([Github](https://github.com/keleshev/schema))
