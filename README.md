# PydayNightFunkin
 This is a rewrite of Friday Night Funkin' (and accidentally half of HaxeFlixel) in python (and some Cython). Why? "Beep boop funny", that would be why.  
 Not a lot is done, but you can at least click through some menus and partake in a few non-recorded, non-penalized vowel-screaming contests.
 
 Used libraries:  
  - pyglet ([Github](https://www.github.com/pyglet/pyglet))
