Things a mod should be able to add:
  - Weeks
   - Songs, duh
  - Characters
  - Stages
  - Gameplay options -> (different savefile, probably)

^ All of this should be somehow baked into a modding system in `core`.

Pull a Teardown and differentiate between content and global mods?
 Global mods would be able to only add more assets or whatever to be used by other mods.
  - Would put heavy stress on asset system since basically everything needs to be turned
    into an asset. Unsure whether that is a good idea.
 Content mods would be able to completely override the base game/introduce custom main menus etc.
