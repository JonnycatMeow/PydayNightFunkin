"""
PydayNightFunkin core submodule.
If it's something behind-the-scene-ish that a normal mortal
doesn't really ever need to modify, it goes here.
This includes, but is certainly not limited to:
 - The custom XML parser
 - The ogg vorbis converter
 - The custom renderer
 - All of the pyglet vertex flip hacks
 - Internal classes that largely grew off of pyglet variants, such
   as sprites and animations.
